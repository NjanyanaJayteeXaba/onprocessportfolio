            <p class="aboutP">Hello there! I'm Jaytee, an IT professional and a passionate Second-year student in the Diploma of Information and Communication Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. After successfully completing my Higher Certificate in Information and Communication Technology last year, I am eager to further my studies in this exciting field. This new chapter allows me to explore deeper technical concepts, foster my creativity, and embrace the challenges that come with advanced learning. I believe that education is a continuous journey, and I am excited to see where this path will lead me.
				During my last year, I developed a solid foundation in programming through my studies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.These languages not gave me the skills, for web development but also sparked my love for coding! I had a time crafting web pages and exploring the boundless creativity of digital design possibilities. Studying the details of user experience and interface design has made me value communication through technology more, than before! As I am busy with my diploma journey now I can't wait to delve into these technologies and improve my skills further.

			<br>
            <p class="aboutP">Besides my coding abilities I've recently started delving into Java, a language widely utilized across applications. This new journey has introduced me to object oriented programming and software development principles. I'm excited to implement my knowledge, in hands on projects and work, alongside colleagues to solve real life problems. The thrill of tackling challenges and the joy of building applications are aspects I eagerly anticipate as I progress through this dynamic learning setting.
				In addition, to my interests I have a passion for delving into the digital realm. I love exploring the internet to uncover emerging technologies and trends that could influence our future. Being part of communities has enabled me to engage with people who share similar interests and exchange ideas and expertise. I believe that learning should be an adventure, of fascinating discoveries. As I progress in my career as an IT professional I am dedicated to making contributions to the technology community and creating an impact, on the world through innovation and cooperation.
